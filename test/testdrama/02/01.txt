Previously on Lost: The Others are coming.
You have only three choices: run, hide, or die.
- We do have a plan.
- Yeah, go to the jungle get some dynamite, blow open a hatch, hide everyone inside.
No.
Stop! Stop it! Stop it, we can't! Stop, don't light it! - 16.
23.
- Hurley, you OK? Huh? Yeah.
Awesome.
I just Have to pee.
Great idea, dude, go look in the burning death hole.
What is it? It doesn't matter what it is.
We blew the door so we could get everyone inside so they'd be safe.
That plan is not gonna work.
We'll never get everyone down in time.
- Water.
- Shallow.
Sounds like a puddle.
- 40 feet down? - 50, tops.
We could use the wire from the fuselage, rig up a harness - John, we're leaving now.
- Yes.
Great idea, let's do that.
- We all went through a lot to get here.
- The ladder is broken.
You're gonna lower They're waiting for us to tell them what do - So forget the harnesses.
- Jack What? Why don't we all just calm down here? No, if you wanna go exploring in the morning, fine, but tonight we're done.
I'm gonna get the dynamite we didn't use and we're heading back to the caves.
So how about you pack it up, John? Sure.
Of course.
OK.
Why don't you want to go down there, Jack? Female, late twenties, no ID.
Coded twice on the way over here - Where's the other one? - They're on their way.
- Fire department had to use the jaws.
- What do we got? - Female, late twenties, auto accident.
- What is that? A piece of the steering column.
Let's go.
Keep that collar steady.
- Page my father.
Tell me.
- Tyre blew, car jumped the divider - Hit an SUV.
- BP's dropping! Pericardial's pierced.
Was she driving? - Yeah.
Alone.
- Where's the driver of the SUV? Watch your back.
Adam Rutherford, 57, chest trauma, no breath sounds.
- Tube Mr Rutherford - I can't intubate, you've got to.
- Dr Shephard, her BP's 80l60.
- His breathing's deteriorating.
- Let's get a move on.
- OK.
I need a syringe.
A big one.
- You, hold pressure.
- Five gauge.
- Pupils? - Fixed and dilated.
- Guys.
- By carotid.
88l52, no radial pulse.
I know, I know.
Sac's flooded.
- Where's that - Here.
Got it? Yep.
- He's dropping, come on.
- Doctor, we're losing him! BP's stabilizing.
Time of death: 8.
15am.
- OK.
Get me a blood gas and a C spine.
- Right away, doctor.
Get her up to ICU and keep her immobilised.
I wanna dance at my wedding.
- Did you hear that? - You need to take it easy, OK? - Just relax - What did she say? She said she has to dance at her wedding.
I wanna dance.
OK, no one is out there.
No one is coming.
But the French woman said The French woman is missing a bloody wing nut.
I mean, it was all bollocks.
It's a ghost story.
She set the fire herself.
What? Nothing.
Has anyone seen Vincent? - The dog? Anyone seen him? - No, I haven't.
- Has anyone seen the dog? - No.
- Where are you going? - I lost the damn dog.
Why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man? Why wouldn't I light the fuse? Maybe because I was running towards you, waving my arms yelling, "Don't do that!" Well, you've got a point there.
I guess I was excited to get inside.
That's why we came here, isn't it? That's why we went out to the Black Rock and got the dynamite to blow the hatch.
We did it so we could get inside, Hugo.
And to save everybody's lives.
And to save everyone's lives.
Or maybe it was just our destiny.
Right, John? Maybe.
Guys.
It's the hatch door.
You'd better see this.
- Vincent! - This is not a good idea.
I saw him five minutes ago.
Besides, you said there wasn't anyone out here.
I said we didn't see anyone.
The dog will come back on his own, he always does.
Watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do.
If something happens to him When was the last time you slept or had something to eat? You're exhausted.
I can't tell that kid I lost his dog because I was exhausted.
- I'll circle around behind him.
- OK.
Vincent! Sayid? Sayid? Where are you? Sayid! Sayid? Walt? What are you doing here? Shannon! What is it? What? Why do you want to get down there so bad? "- Ly".
Why do I want to get down there so "badly"? Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he? Why? Cos you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside by a foot-thick steel door that says "Quarantine"? Look at the bright side: the damage is done.
Bright side.
And if Jack thinks I've lost it, I can't blame him, really.
Then again, five hours ago I was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke.
Did you see it, Kate? Then I guess we're both crazy.
I wonder what Jack thinks he saw.
You should go ahead, man.
Don't want Locke making time with your girl.
Joke, dude.
Not really in the mood, Hurley.
Really? Wow.
Usually you're like, Mr Ha-ha.
There ya go.
Life's not so bad, right? Sure, the Others are coming to like, eat us all and every once in a while someone blows up all over you but we do get to sleep in every morning.
And the numbers? - What? - "The numbers are bad.
" That's what you were yelling right when I tackled you.
- Yeah.
It's kind of a long story.
- I've got time.
- You'll think I'm crazy.
- Try me.
A while ago, I was in this kind of psych ward and there was this guy, Leonard.
All the time I knew him, all he ever said were these numbers.
"4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42".
Over and over and over again.
And they kind of got stuck in my head.
So when I got out well, actually a couple months after I got out I was buying a frozen burrito and thought "I should play the lottery" and I guess those numbers were stuck in my head, so I played them.
And I won $114 million.
That's when it started happening.
My grandpa died my house caught on fire the chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor Well, actually, a meteorite.
OK, so, tonight, I see the same freaking numbers on that hatch thing.
Just written on the side.
And that's why I tried to stop it, because that thing is cursed, man.
You were in a psych ward? - I'm not crazy.
- I'm not saying you are.
- So, what, that's it? That's all? - What do you want me to say? - How about you believe me? - Hurley, they're numbers.
What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you? - Bedside manner.
- Yeah, that.
Yours sucks, dude.
What happened to him? Just try to relax, OK? The car that I hit.
The other driver was older He died in the ER.
I can't feel anything.
I know.
What's happened to me? You have a fracture dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine with multiple crushed vertebrae.
Your back is broken.
Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen and has to be stopped.
I'm gonna operate and repair as much as possible but even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at extremely unlikely.
Dr Shephard, may I have a word, please? - So, what'd I do wrong? - You did something wrong? - You're frowning.
- My face is always this way.
Dad, hey, come on, let's hear it.
You might want to try handing out some hope every once in a while? Even if there's a 99 per cent probability that they're hopelessly screwed folks are much more inclined to hear that one per cent chance that things are gonna be OK.
Her spine is crushed.
I tell her that everything's gonna be OK, that's false hope, Dad.
Maybe.
Maybe.
But it's still hope.
X- Ray to the ER.
I know what I saw! It was him.
It was Walt.
- Please lower your voice.
- I heard whispers.
- Where? - Everywhere.
- What whispers? Who? - I don't know! "Them".
- Something happened to the raft? - Nothing happened.
- Walt was with your husband, Sawyer - Sayid, I know what I saw! They're back.
Locke found a hatch in the ground about a half mile from here.
We left to blow it open so we could hide inside.
So all of us could hide inside in case But it doesn't matter, it's not gonna work there's no way for all of us to get in there tonight.
Jack, where's Dr Arzt? - He didn't make it.
- What? - Oh, my God.
- Did you see them? - Did you see the Others? - Hey! Shannon! There are no "Others".
- We've had this conversation.
- What would you know? You didn't see anything.
You don't know! You don't know! Hey! Everything's going to be OK.
Let's just Let's take it easy.
We're gonna be all right.
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK? Together.
We've still got four guns.
We'll put lookouts at all the entrances.
We're all gonna be safe as long as we stay together.
The sun comes up in three hours and we are all gonna be here to see that happen.
I promise.
- John.
What are you doing? - I'm getting some cable.
What for? It's for the hatch.
I'm going in.
You think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John? I doubt it.
In fact, you're right.
Safest thing is to stay here.
Wait for morning.
Wait for these "Others", to see if they ever show up.
Wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help.
But me? I'm tired of waiting.
So, do you believe it? Believe what? That everything's gonna be OK.
Yeah.
I do.
Kind of unlike you.
The whole glass-half-full thing.
There's a glass? You did a good thing.
Saying what you said.
Taking care of everybody.
And just giving them something to count on.
If you weren't here, Jack I'm going to the hatch.
I understand why you can't go.
I mean, they need you here, I get it.
I do.
But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not.
And if he falls and breaks his neck Live together, die alone, right? Right.
Your fianc√©e was seriously injured.
It could take as long as ten, maybe twelve hours.
I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside.
She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.
When is it? The wedding? It's eight months.
I'm sure Sarah will have recovered by then, if "Recovered?" What does that mean? There will be ongoing physical therapy - But if she works really hard - Will we be able to you know Make love? You need to know that there is a chance Sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.
What, like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself? Come here.
Come here.
I want to tell you a little secret.
Come on.
Closer.
It's OK.
I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore.
I can still roll around at my wedding.
You're invited, OK? I'm going to fix you.
Expected to find you halfway down there by now.
I was waiting for you.
- So you want me to go down first? - Well, you're lighter.
I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy.
Shaft might get narrower down there, too.
You left out the part where you just wanna see if I get eaten by something.
Yeah, well.
That too.
- Not too tight? - I've got it.
OK.
Wait.
What do I say if need to stop? "Stop.
" Right.
OK.
Let's go.
Kate! Are you all right? Yeah.
I dropped the light.
Maybe we should Well, OK, then.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Stop! What is it? John! I think there's something down Kate, are you all right? Kate! You're kidding, right? You're going back? - Yeah.
- What about all that stuff you said about waiting until morning and watching the sun rise? I changed my mind.
Kate! Locke! Damn it! - You all right, brother? - I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Take it easy, keep the weight off.
Here, let me look.
Does this hurt? Well, you haven't sprained it, then.
Don't fancy your chances of catching up, though.
- I wasn't trying to catch up.
- Oh, aye, 'course you weren't.
- What do you know about sprains? - I was almost a doctor, once.
Small world.
You're a doctor, then? - So what's your excuse? - Excuse? For running like the Devil's chasing you? My excuse: I'm training.
- Training for what? - For a race around the world.
Impressive, I know.
So your excuse better be good, brother.
Just trying to work a few things out.
A girl, right? - A patient.
- Ah, but, a girl patient.
What's her name? - Her name's Sarah.
- What'd you do to her, then? Do to her? You must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation.
I told her I made a promise I couldn't keep.
I told her I'd fix her and I couldn't.
I failed.
Well, right.
Just one thing What if you did fix her? - I didn't.
- But what if you did? You don't know what you're talking about.
I don't? Why not? With her situation, that would be a miracle, "brother".
And you don't believe in miracles.
Right.
Well, then.
I'm gonna give you some advice, anyway.
You have to lift it up.
Lift it up? Your ankle.
You got to keep it elevated.
It's been nice chatting - Jack.
- Jack, I'm Desmond.
Well, good luck, brother.
See you in another life, yeah? I wouldn't do that.
Where's Kate? What the hell's Am I alive? Yeah.
Yeah, you're alive.
You smell.
- Well, thank you.
- Wow.
You really smell.
Yeah, I went for a run.
You smell like you ran far.
Well, I showered.
I guess I just didn't cool I wanted to get back down here and check on you and It was a tour de stade.
What? When you run all the steps in every section of a stadium.
Up and down.
Why would you do that? I'm intense.
- Did you finish? - No, I hurt my ankle.
That sucks for you.
Is Kevin here? My fianc√©? I didn't see him.
- I'm sure he'll be back in a little - Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.
Are you gonna tell me how it went? Sarah, the the damage to your back was extensive.
I did everything that I could, but your spinal column, I just I couldn't repair it.
You're going to be paralysed from the waist down for the rest of your life.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
You're yanking my chain, right? No.
Then how come I can wiggle my toes? Can you feel this? Yes.
- Can you feel this? - Yes.
- This? - Yes.
- This? - Yes.
Move and I kill him.
Put the gun down.
- Where's Kate? - Jack, it's OK - I said, drop it! - Where's Kate? - She's fine.
Put down - I'm not putting down anything! Do you want him to die? Put it down.
Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your "destiny"? - "All roads lead here?" - Jack, calm down.
Lower your gun, or I'll blow his damned head off, brother! You?
